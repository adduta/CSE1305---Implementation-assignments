# CSE1305 - Implementation assignments
This repository contains the weekly implementation assignments of the course "Algorithms and data structures", that together build the fundamentals in various topics of algorithms and data structures (types of sorting, type of trees, maps, stacks, queues). 

This was built as a motivation for myself to complete all homework given out in the course, so it does not contain complete/correct solutions for everything, as I prioritised things as the quarter went. However, for most of the exercises it contains full and correct solutions.

These are also solutions only proposed by me.
